We launched One-Time Secret on [November 8th, 2011](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3207489). Today we're happy to announce the first opensource release of the One-Time Secret codebase under the MIT License. This is something we wanted to do from the very beginning but life and other work got in the way. It's important that we do everything we can to earn and maintain your trust and this is a crucial step in that direction. Also, *it's just the right thing to do.*

#### What is a One-Time Secret? ####

A one-time secret is a link that can be viewed only one time. A single-use URL.

#### Why would I want to use it? ####

When you send people sensitive info like passwords and private links via email or chat, there are copies of that information stored in many places. If you use a one-time link instead, the information persists for a single viewing which means it can't be read by someone else later. This allows you to send sensitive information in a safe way knowing it's seen by one person only. Think of it like a self-destructing message.
