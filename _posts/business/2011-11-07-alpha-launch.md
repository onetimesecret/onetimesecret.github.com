Today we're happy to announce the first public alpha of [One-Time Secret](https://onetimesecret.com/). We've been running the service privately for a few months and we're now ready to open it up for feedback.

### What is a One-Time Secret? ###

A one-time secret is a link that can be viewed only one time. When you send people passwords and private links via email or chat, there are copies of that information stored in many places. If you use a one-time link instead, the information persists for a single viewing which means it can't be read by someone else later. This allows you to send sensitive information in a safe way knowing it's seen by one person only. Think of it like a self-destructing message.
