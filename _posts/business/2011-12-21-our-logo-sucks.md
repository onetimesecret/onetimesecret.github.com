We've been getting a lot of fantastic feedback from users about One-Time Secret, and it's been great. However, not all feedback has been praise. One that we've also gotten is: 'I like your site, but your logo sucks!', and we totally agree!

<img src="/img/2011-12-21-logo-yuck.png" alt="sucky logo" title="it hurts my eyes!" height="108" width="662" />

So, we've decided to do something about it. We're programmers, and clearly not designers, so we've [launched a contest for a logo](https://onetimesecret.com/logo). We'll be offering t-shirts, props and free accounts for the top candidates.

If you think you've got the chops to come up with a better logo, please let us know. We could clearly use the help!
