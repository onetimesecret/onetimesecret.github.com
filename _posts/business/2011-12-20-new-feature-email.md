We released email support over the weekend. It's now possible to send a secret link directly to the recipient when you create a secret. We had a lot of requests for this feature in part because it's more convenient but it's also more secure, as  [a Metafilter user points out](http://www.metafilter.com/110618/Spill-Then-Poof#4085300).

For now, email support is available only for users with an account. We decided to do this to prevent abuse but may open it up to anonymous users later on.
