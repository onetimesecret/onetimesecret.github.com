We received a tonne of feedback since our [alpha launch](/2011/11/07/alpha-launch/) last month along with tens of blog posts, hundreds of tweets, and thousands of unique visitors. We even got a [retweet from TV's Drew Carey](https://twitter.com/DrewFromTV/status/142730130689761280) (my grandmother, who's been watching Price is Right since the 70s, got a kick out of that one). We considered all the feedback, made a bunch of improvements, and today we're announcing our beta.

### Key improvements ###

* A REST API
* Secrets can now live for up to 90 days
* Many UI improvements
* A mini-feedback form at the bottom of every page
* User accounts and paid plans

### A few numbers ###

We had about 30,000 uniques in November and about 7,000 so far in December. All told we've delivered about 15,000 secrets.  

#### November 2011 ####

There were over 10,000 uniques the day we launched which dwarfs the rest of the month. The little bump the second week was from a tweet from [Maria Popova](https://twitter.com/brainpicker) which had around 116k followers. The rest of the month hovers around 200-500 uniques per day.
